# Reverse pattern match question type [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timhunt/moodle-qtype_xsdvalidator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timhunt/moodle-qtype_xsdvalidator)

The pattern match question type allows the teacher to grade sentences entered by
the student using the pattern-match language. This question type does it backwards.
The teacher provides some sentences, and says whether or not they should be matched,
and the student has to come up with a pattern-match expression that does that.
This question type is intended to be used to help people learn pattern-match
syntax.

The pattern-match language is documented at
http://docs.moodle.org/dev/The_OU_PMatch_algorithm


## Acknowledgements

This question type was created by Tim Hunt just for fun.
